# JQC: Java Quantum Computing

## JQC Syntax:
- One-line commands
- Case-specific + Whitespace-specific
- File I/O must be specified as such
    - Input file will be requested at the start of the program
    - Output file may be stated in the JQC commands itself as such "file:path/to/file" in the target token
- Command template: [Action] [Type] [Origin] [Target] 
- Structure like verbal English commands: "Do this action to that type's target"
